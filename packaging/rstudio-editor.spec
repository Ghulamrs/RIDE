#   and then ../lib. Under /usr that second one is /usr/lib, and dropping
#   shmrt-x86_64-linux.a into /usr/lib would be rude.
#
#   cc1.exe has its include directory compiled in - CC1_INCLUDE_DIR - so it is
#   set at build time below to where this package puts the headers.
#
# /opt/rstudio/bin goes on PATH through profile.d, which is the ordinary way to
# do that for a self-contained prefix.

# No Source tags. rpmbuild checks that each one names a file it can find, and
# what this builds from is three checkouts sitting side by side - which is a
# real and useful thing to build from, and not a tarball. --define _sourcedir
# says where they are. A tarball release would list them here and unpack them
# in %prep instead.

%description
RStudio is a terminal editor for three languages: C through cc1, C++ through
cxx1, and Shalimar through shc - with the host's own C and C++ compiler one
key away for the first two. It edits, builds, runs and debugs without leaving
the keyboard.

This package carries all four programs, because the editor drives the other
three and is not much use on its own:

  RStudio.exe   the editor
  cc1.exe       a C compiler, three targets, its own DWARF
  cxx1.exe      a C++11 compiler, the same three targets, its own DWARF
  shc.exe       a compiler for Shalimar, and the runtime it links against

The manual is in %{prefix_dir}/share/doc, and Help > Contents inside the
editor lists the same pages.

%prep
# Nothing is unpacked. The three source trees are built where they are, which
# is what a spec built from checkouts side by side can honestly do; a tarball
# release would use %setup here instead.

%build
# cc1 first, and its include directory is where this package will put it -
# not $(CURDIR)/lib, which is the build tree and will not exist afterwards.
%make_build -C %{_sourcedir}/Compiler-C INCDIR=%{prefix_dir}/lib/cc1

# cxx1 the same way, with both of its header directories placed: lib/ holds
# the C headers and include/ the C++ ones on top. The checkout is called C++
# beside the others on the machine this is written on and Compiler-Cpp on
# GitHub; the RPM takes the repository's name.
%make_build -C %{_sourcedir}/Compiler-Cpp INCDIR=%{prefix_dir}/lib/cxx1 \
    CXXINCDIR=%{prefix_dir}/include/cxx1

# shc, and both runtime archives with it.
%make_build -C %{_sourcedir}/Compiler-S

# The editor last, because it is the one that drives the other two.

%check
# The compilers are asked to do their actual job, on a program small enough to
# have an answer worth checking. Building a package that installs a compiler
# that cannot compile is the failure worth catching here.
# What is compared is what each program *printed*, not what it returned.
# rpmbuild runs a scriptlet under set -e, so a probe that deliberately exits
# 42 kills the script before anything can look at the status - which is how
# this check failed the first time it ran, on a build where both compilers
# were perfectly fine.

# what is being checked is that the compiler produced a working program - the
# exact spacing of ? is the language's business and tests/cases is where it is
# pinned down.

%changelog
* Fri Sep 11 2026 G. R. Akhtar <akhtar170313@gmail.com> - 3.0-1
- RStudio 3.0, the release cxx1 arrived in: C++ goes to cxx1 by default and
  to the host's compiler by name. cxx1.exe and its two header directories
  join the package. Not yet rebuilt as an RPM since this change.
* Sat Aug 22 2026 G. R. Akhtar <akhtar170313@gmail.com> - 1.1-1
- First package. RStudio 1.1, the release Shalimar arrived in.
