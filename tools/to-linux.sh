# Builds this editor on the Linux box and runs both suites there.
#
# Three reasons it is worth doing, and only the first is the obvious one.
#
# It is the third machine, and the editor claims to be one editor on all three.
# It is built with real g++ rather than Apple's clang, which is the only thing
# that can say whether the sources are ISO C++14 - Apple's libc++ hands you
# C++17 names under -std=c++14, so a C++17-ism compiles clean on a Mac and
# passes the host suite. And it is where a C++ group goes to g++ rather than to
# clang++ or cl, which is a routing this editor now makes and nowhere else can
# check.
#
# A tarball rather than that box's own clone, which is a deliberate choice and
# not an oversight. There *is* a clone there - ~/CC1StudioWorkbench, on the old
# repository name - and it has git, unlike the Windows box. But a clone can only
# ever have what has been pushed, and this script exists to check what is in the
# working tree *before* it is committed. The clone also drifts: it was eight
# commits behind on 2026-08-21 with a stale origin/main, which at a glance reads
# like divergent work by somebody else.
#
# So: this relays and builds from clean, the clone stays as it is, and neither
# pretends to be the other. If you want the clone up to date, push and pull it -
# that is a different job from this one.

# whose own tools/verify-three re-extracts and rebuilds ~/cxx1-verify on every

# src/obj is excluded and that is not tidiness. The first run of this script
# carried the Mac's own Mach-O objects over, make found them newer than the

# the kind. Everything is built from clean there for the same family of reason
# Compiler-S's relay gives.
# Built things are excluded by name as well as by suffix: tests/test and
# tests/session have no extension, so a Mach-O one travelled over and make
# found it newer than tests/test.cpp - "cannot execute binary file", which
# reads as a broken box and is the Mac's own binary being run on Linux.
